# RawPlusJpeg
Rob Cole's RawPlusJpeg LightRoom Plug-In, forked at version 2.5.2 (circa 2014)

The robcole.com website has been dead for several months, and folks have been scrambling to find surviving copies of the RawPlusJpeg plug-in. 

So I uploaded my last download of RawPlusJpeg here, after checking that the license allows it. This was version 2.5.2.

Apparently a version 3.0 also existed, so if you have it, please share it!
