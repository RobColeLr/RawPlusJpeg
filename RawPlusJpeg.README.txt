rc Raw Plus Jpeg, Version: 2.5.2

First-time Installation & Configuration
=======================================

*** See below for subsequent installations / updating.

-  Unzip the downloaded plugin into a folder of your choosing (I recommend putting in "Documents/FromOthers/RobCole", but can go anywhere,
   *except* do NOT put in "Program Files" folder or in with operating system files...), and remember its location for step 4.
   (plugin is used in place and therefore must not be moved after installation)
-  Open Lightroom's Plugin Manager (on the File Menu).
-  Click the 'Add' Button (lower left).
-  Select the folder whose name ends with '.lrplugin' (including the dot, but not the apostrophes),
   which is *inside* the folder where the plugin was unzipped in step 1.
   *** Mac users: the correct folder to select may appear as a "plugin", instead of a folder proper.
-  Click 'OK'.
-  Review the information presented by the plugin manager, and edit settings if necessary or desirable.
-  Click 'Done'.
